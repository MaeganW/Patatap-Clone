<p>Showcase Skills: Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, Howler.js, Paper.js.  A light-hearted patatap clone made just for the fun of it and completed as an exercise from Colt Steele's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/content">Web Developer Bootcamp Course</a>.  Please Enjoy! :)</p>
